  "body": "# What is Torrenter ++\r\nTorrenter++ is a torrenting software that works based on tracker and shares torrent using a torrent number. The torrent number is generated at the creation of a torrent and once generated any user can use the torrent number to download the file at their convenience. No blocking can be done unless the tracker is taken down. This is suitable for small organizations, hostel rooms, home etc.\r\n##Developement\r\nTorrenter++ has been developed using Java and hence is platform independent. It has not been properly coded. Hence a restructuring is on the way. You may download and create your versions of torrenter++, but should maintain the credit for the authors in the code.\r\n### \\#torrenter++",
